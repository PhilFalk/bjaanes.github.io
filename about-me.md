My name is Gjermund Bjaanes. I am 27 years old, born and raised in Norway. I am a developer, geek, enthusiast and innovator. I&#8217;m passionate about software engineering and all things new and fancy in tech. 
Currently I focus mostly on innovation and new technology. It's what I do while working, and it's mostly what I do when not working - because I am truly passionate. It's what I live for.

I am a software engineer and innovator by trade and **by passion**.

I have always had a very enthusiastic interest for computers, dated to when I was little. It becameÂ  an obsession for programming, IT, gadgets and new technology. 

I worked as a pure developer for a few years, before diving into a more innovative position where I can explore and tinker with technology in a much more interesting way. I love to learn, and I love to create.

Other than that; In my spare time I like to code, read, cook, hang out with friends and to work out.

I am employed at Flatirons as a Technical Leader of Innovation. That means that my job is find new innovative use cases we can work with - while getting to play with (err, learn about) a lot of cool new tech!
