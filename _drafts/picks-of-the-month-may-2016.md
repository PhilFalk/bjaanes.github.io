Welcome to Picks of the month, where I share a few things I have found useful the last month.

It can be anything from blog posts and software tools to books and techniques.

# #1 Angular Performance: Tuning the Engine by Todd Motto

I recently attended a neat webinar with Todd Motto about Angular 1.X performance tuning.

I knew quite a bit of the tips given, but there were several new and also some that I had forgotten about.

If you develop Angular 1.X applications, I suggest that you take a look at the recording.

# #2 Jekyll

Jekyll is a static website generator. It allows you to create a nice and simple blog with Markdown files and simple configuration.
 
I recently moved this very blog from Wordpress to Jekyll.

Being able to have a much lighter footprint, and simpler technology stack is very neat, but having all my content on Github, that is just gold!

I mean:

* Everything is source controlled
* I can publish with "git push"
* I can accept pull requests (to fix spelling mistakes for instance, or even new posts if someone wanted to write one)
* Less backup to worry about (I trust Github <3)

I wrote in more detail about the reasons for the switch here:

If you want to take a peak under the hood of this blog, be my guest:

# #3 Hackathon

This is perhaps a slightly abstract pick, but I recently attended Angular Attack 2016, an online Angular hackathon:
[https://www.angularattack.com/](https://www.angularattack.com/){:target="_blank"} 

It was a bunch of fun and I learned a lot about Angular 2, MQTT and Websockets. All in all it was a fun and educational.

If can attend either a physical or online hackathon that fit you, I really recommend that you do it. 
It allows you to really let yourself loose and just learn something new and cool within a short period of time.

If you want to read some more about what I created, you can read my blogs post about it:

[Angular Attack 2016 Submission]({{ site.baseurl }}/angular-attack-2016-submission/){:target="_blank"} 

The app allows you view MQTT data in real time. I called it the MQTT Dashboard.

The technology behind it is described in the blog post.

If you just want to take the app for a spin, you can find it here:

Here is also a quick demo I created of it:
