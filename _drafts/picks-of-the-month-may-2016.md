Welcome to Picks of the month, where I share a few things I have found useful the last month.

It can be anything from blog posts and software tools to books and techniques.

# #1 Angular Performance: Tuning the Engine by Todd Motto

I recently attended a neat webinar with Todd Motto about Angular 1.X performance tuning.

I knew quite a bit of the tips given, but there were several new and also some that I had forgotten about.

If you develop Angular 1.X applications, I suggest that you take a look at the recording.

# #2 Jekyll

The static website generator Jekyll is very cool. I recently moved this very blog from Wordpress to Jekyll.

Being able to have a much lighter footprint, and simpler technology stack is very neat, but having all my content on Github, that is just gold!

I mean:

* Everything is source controlled
* I can publish with "git push"
* I can accept pull requests (to fix spelling mistakes for instance, or even new posts if someone wanted to write one)
* Less backup to worry about (I trust Github <3)

I wrote in more detail about the reasons for the switch here:

If you want to take a peak under the hood of this blog, be my guest:
