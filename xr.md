Extreme Results is an Open Source software solution for implementing J.D Meier's 
personal productivity system, Getting Results The Agile Way (Also called Agile Results).

Agile results is very simple system design for getting meaningful results, instead
of just "getting things done". If you aren't getting the right things done, 
you are not actually getting any real results.
