Extreme Results is an Open Source software solution for implementing J.D Meier's 
personal productivity system, Getting Results The Agile Way (Also called Agile Results).

# What is Agile Results?

Agile Results is very simple system designed for getting meaningful results, instead
of just "getting things done". If you aren't getting the *right* things done, 
you are not actually getting any results, you are just keeping busy.

The word agile in this context comes from the software development methodology, Agile Development.
It's based on being able to be flexible enough to evolve and change with response to change.
 
But what changes in personal productivity? You learn new things about yourself, what you do and how you do it.
And this is part of the Agile Results as well. Being able to reflect and become better all the time.

## The basics of Agile Results

The basics of Agile Results is very simple. 

Every part of the system is completely optional, and if you ever forget to use it's very easy to get started again.
The simplicity and modularity of it all makes the barrier for entry very small.

What I want to focus on, is the outcomes and the reflections of the system. They are very simple, but equally powerful.

### Outcomes

The point of the outcomes is to outline 3 outcomes you want to achieve within a specific time frame. The time frames are daily, weekly, monthly and yearly. Each one is broader and more ambitious than the next (The _yearly_ one being the biggest outcomes, and the _daily_ one the smallest outcomes).

And you have to limit yourself to just three. This is really important!

For the daily one you pick three goals you want to have achieved by the end of the day. You can do more, but these three are the wins you commit to that day. And you can use the weekly goals to find out which daily goals makes most sense to you - and so on...

The great part about the outcomes is that it scales really well. You don't have to set up goals for the year, the month and the week. You can pick and choose! They make sense even if you don't have them all.

The one I highly recommend you at least stick with, is the daily one. It's the real driver for action in my experience. If you start with that (and you can do it right now - just write down 3 wins for the day!), you can easily add more goals later - if you want to.

And again, if you forget for a few days, it's easy to get back up on the horse. Just write down 3 things you want to have done by the end of the day. Super simple!

### Reflections

You use reflections to learn and improve upon your process.

For instance, you can look back at the week that went by, and note down the following things:

* 3 things that went well
* 3 things to improve 

So you have to focus on what you actually accomplished, and celebrate yourself for that, 
but also learn about your mistakes and make sure you do better next time.

Using the reflections, you can improve the goals you choose (so that you choose good goals that you can actually finish), 
and the way you do them.
 
If things change, and you have to do things differently, this is where these things can be caught easily.
