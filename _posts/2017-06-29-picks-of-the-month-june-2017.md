Welcome to Picks of the month, where I share a few things I have found useful the last month.


It can be anything from blog posts and software tools to books and techniques.

# #1 Fabulous

![Fabulous App]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/posts/fabulous.png)

> "Fabulous is a science-based app, incubated in Duke's Behavioral Economics Lab, that will help you build healthy rituals into your life, just like an elite athlete."

This app is fantastic! It has helped me break a few bad habits and create several new good ones. I now have a healthy and great morning routine that truly sets the bar for the day!

This is my morning routine right now:


1. Drink lots of water
2. Exercise (short run or a quick 5-minute intense strength routine)
3. Take a SUPER COLD shower
4. Get dressed
5. Meditate
6. Eat a healthy breakfast
7. Take my vitamins
8. Walk the dog


This routine works for me. I feel so ready to face the day after this. I feel awake (much thanks to that shower) energized and just... ready!

But this app is not just for you morning habits; it's about your habits in general. It explains everything along the way in an excellent way. It also helps that they can point to science and real results to back up their claims. I mean, it helps me at least!

If you are anything like me and want some serious personal and professional growth, try out this app. It's terrific!

# #2 Here One

![Here One Wireless Earbuds]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/posts/hereone.jpg)

Wireless Smart Earbuds. 2 out of 3 of those words are true at least. They are Wireless and they are Earbuds, but I wouldn't exactly call them smart. Perhaps clever, but not really "smart".

However, I wouldn't put the buds up here if I didn't like them though. They have a few cool features which are why I bought them.

The number 1 feature (except for working like any pair of wireless earbuds) is that they can filter your real-world audio. What does that even mean? It means that you can put different filters and even use an equalizer on the sound that goes directly into your ear.

What? Yes. You can in theory filter out different sounds, but still hear the things you want to hear. For instance, you can filter out the background noise of an airplane, but still, hear other things around you. To some extent, it's not 100% magical. You can still hear the other sounds, but it's quite good!

My favorite use case is to listen to music or audiobooks/podcasts and still hear when someone is talking to me. I can then just tap the earbud to stop the music and have a conversation (still with the earbuds in, because they let the sound in).

You can even *amplify* the sound around you - which is kind of weird. But cool! And potentially useful...

Anyway, I like these. They are not exactly smart, but they sure have some cool things going for them. If hearables (yes, that is what this product category is called) get even better, I think they can bring a lot of value.
