Welcome to Picks of the month, where I share a few things I have found useful the last month.

It can be anything from blog posts and software tools to books and techniques.

<!--more-->
Welcome to this month&#8217;s &#8216;Picks of the month&#8217; &#8211; March 2015. Every month I deliver a few picks of my favorite things that I want to share that month. The picks themselves can be almost anything. Software tools, books (technical as well as fictional), blog posts, resources and so on.

In this edition I have a couple of picks which I am very exited about. One of which I have used for several years, and on I have just started using. Both are excellent!

# #1 Pluralsight

Pluralsight is a online training platform with videos and tutorials for &#8216;Hardcore developer and IT training&#8217;.

This particular site is something I have not used before, but It’s one of those good new things. I have used codeschool a little previously, and liked that a lot, but I was truly blown away by Pluralsight.

I have used it for learning more advanced AngularJS topics, and it’s really easy to find the up-to-date and high-quality courses.

It’s something I am going to keep using for learning new topics I am interested in. I was surprised by sheer amount of content on that site. Whatever you fancy, they probably got it.

# #2 Evernote

Evernote is a free app for mobile and desktop that you can use for almost everything. In it’s most basic form it’s just a note-taking app. But it has so many great features that basically makes it an ecosystem for your mind. I like to think of it as a place where I can store everything I don&#8217;t want to go around remembering (so almost everything) &#8211; a second brain.

I have used Evernote for several years, and have a lot of content stored in it. It gets better the more you use it (the more content you have there, the more value it provides). I cannot tell you enough how much I love using Evernote (hint: I am using Evernote to write this very article).

I will come out with an article on how I use Evernote, so keep an eye out for that.
