ES6, ES2015, or whatever you want to call it, introduced a new class syntax for the javascript world, 
and there has been quite a bit of controversy surrounding it. Some people even say you should never use it.
  
In this post, I will explain what these things are, and try to explore where this controversy comes from,
and if there is anything to it.

Thoughts about this post thus far:

* Brief introduction to prototypal inheritance
    * Link to a more in-depth tutorial as well
* Brief introduction to ES6 class syntax
    * Explain that the ES6 class syntax is syntactical sugar for protoypal (come back to this point in conclusions) 
* Brief introduction to people saying ES6 classes are evil
* What I propose => es6 class is nice, but you need to know prototypal stuff
