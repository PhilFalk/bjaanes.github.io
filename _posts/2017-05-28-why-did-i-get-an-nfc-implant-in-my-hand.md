I recently went to Norway's first "Implant Party," which essentially is a meetup with hand piercings (with NFC. Oh, and they are implanted in your hand). 

<!--more-->

The event went like this: There was a talk about biohacking and NFC chip implants, and then a professional piercing artists started implanting those who wanted it. I was one of them.

The guys that did the implantation was [Biohax International](http://biohaxsweden.com){:target="_blank"}.

If you are not familiar with NFC, I suggest you watch this quick video on the subject:

# How is it implanted?

It's a lot like taking a little piercing. Sure, the needle is not the smallest, but there is almost no pain. No worse than taking some blood at the doctor's office.

The needle itself is a contraption in which the NFC chip is contained. When the needle is inserted, you just push the NFC chip into the hand.

It's easier to just show it (warning: there is a needle in this video...):

(Yes, that is me turning into a cyborg in that video).

As you can see, the procedure is quick. There was no pain. And the healing process has been painless and swift as well.

# But why?

It seems like it might be weird to want to implant an NFC chip in your hand. After all, it sounds like it will hurt, and seriously, what's the point?

Funnily enough, I didn't have any *particular* reason for doing, other than that I liked the idea of hacking my body. I figured: "I'll just get it implanted and explore from there." 

So that is essentially why. I am curious. I want to explore what I can use an NFC chip in my hand for.

I am thinking about maybe using it for unlocking doors. "Logging in" to my smart house when I get home. I at least think I should be able to find some use cases for it during my IoT exploration.

I am an innovator, and exploring things like this is what drives me. Also, it's fun.
