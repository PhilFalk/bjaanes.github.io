Welcome to Picks of the month, where I share a few things I have found useful the last month.

It can be anything from blog posts and software tools to books and techniques.

<!--more-->
This month's picks are going to be a couple of things I have recently enjoyed quite a lot.

# #1 ng-conf 2015

This AngularJS conference was march 5-6, but I only recently started watching the talks online.

If you are at all interested in AngularJS, i truly recommend taking the time to watching the talks, that are all available online as far as I can see. They talk a lot about Angular 2, Angular 1.x and going forward, tips and tricks, and lots of other stuff.

I have learned a lot of stuff that I am going to get much use out of going forward with my Angular development.

Go to <a href="http://www.ng-conf.org/" target="_blank">http://www.ng-conf.org/</a> and learn a ton about Angular as well as were it's going!

# #2 The 5K iMac

I just had to pick this one.

I recently switched out my entire development rig for a ‘fully’ upgraded iMac 27” with 5K display. It is without a doubt the single most beautiful piece of hardware I have ever had. It was expense as hell, but it’s just so nice.

It really makes it easy to get a clean desk:

I have nothing to distract me, and that has been really great. It’s much easier to focus. I recently wrote about that here:
  
<a href="http://gjermundbjaanes.com/keep-your-life-and-code-clutter-free/" target="_blank">Keep your life (and code) clutter-free</a>

The monitor is also insanely crisp and everything looks really vibrant on it. The resolution make it very easy to multitask. More pixels > more monitors. I also want a secondary 5K monitor now, because... Well, it would be awesome!

Not the most insightful picks this month, but a couple of things I have really appreciated at least.
