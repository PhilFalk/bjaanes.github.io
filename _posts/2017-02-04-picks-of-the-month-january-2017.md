Welcome to Picks of the month, where I share a few things I have found useful the last month.

It can be anything from blog posts and software tools to books and techniques.

New year. New picks. More books :)

# #1 The Book of Joy: Lasting Happiness in a Changing World

[![The Book of Joy Cover]({{ site.baseurl}}/img/posts/book_of_joy_cover.jpg)]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/posts/book_of_joy_cover.jpg)

This book is by the 14th Dalai Lama, Desmond Tutu, and Douglas Abrams. These are some of the most loving and positive men in the world. And this book shows it.

Reading this book has been one of the most positive experiences I have had lately. It really inspired me! I heard the audio book version on Audible, and I even bought a physical copy to keep around (starting to read it for the 2nd time now!).

These spiritual leaders share with the world their thoughts and feelings about how we can find joy and happiness in a world with so much suffering. The answer turns out to be love, compassion, and inner peace.
It's a bit more complex than that, but you can indeed find happiness within yourself if you do it right.

I highly recommend everyone reading this book. We could all use more joy, happiness, love and compassion in our world. I just hope this book can help out a bit!

# #2 Blockchain Revolution: How the Technology Behind Bitcoin Is Changing Money, Business, and the World

[![Blockchain RevolutionCover]({{ site.baseurl}}/img/posts/blockchain_revolution_cover.jpg)]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/posts/blockchain_revolution_cover.jpg)

Blockchain Revolution is written by team Tapscott: Don and Alex Tapscott. They have used this book as an opportunity to share their positive outlook on blockchain technology and the future. The book was inspiring and gave me hope!

I am currently writing quite a long blog post about blockchain technology, and this book has been used as inspiration for big parts of it.

If you are interested in what blockchain can do for you, the world, and everything in between then this book is an excellent choice.

# #3 Grammarly

Grammarly is a writing app and spell checker that helps you write better. It has a Chrome plugin, a web app and an MS Office integration so that you can improve your writing almost everywhere.

The free version has a good spell checker, but the premium version helps you to write better too. It finds a lot of subtle errors and points of improvement. The paid version is quite expensive, though, starting at $12 a month (if you pay for a whole year in one go) to $29 a month.
I think it just might be worth it. But you should try it out and see if it can do anything for you.

I just discovered this tool, and it is great! I haven't used it too much in professional settings yet, but while writing my blog posts, it has been a fine companion. I have found a lot of stupid errors I probably would have overlooked otherwise.
