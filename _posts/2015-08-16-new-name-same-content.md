I have struggled a bit lately with the name of the blog, and how I want to portrait it to the world. I eventually came to the conclusion that Maximum Developer is only a partially correct name for the blog.

<!--more-->
I still want to write about becoming the best possible developer, but i also want to be "able" to write about whatever I want. I have actually already done this all the time, but I felt a bit bad about the AngularJS specific posts and whatnot. I don't want that.

I created this blog to be able to express myself, and hopefully help someone else when they are struggling with stuff. Because of this, I feel like just using my own name as the name of the blog works better than &#8216;Maximum Developer'.

&nbsp;

Once again, I am still just as devoted to writing posts to help people becoming their absolutely best, I just want the freedom to not JUST talk about that. I want to talk about exciting new technology, wierd bugs, guides, frustrations and anything else I just feel like writing about.

&nbsp;

So, I hope you will keep coming back to gjermundbjaanes.com. I have some great content lined up coming out the next weeks and months!

PS! I will probably do some more design changes around here, but for now, the current one works OK.
