Welcome to Picks of the month, where I share a few things I have found useful the last month.

It can be anything from blog posts and software tools to books and techniques.

This post is kind of a cheat post, but I still think this is very important - especially if you are a hard worker!

# #1 Vacation

Take some time off. Take a good break to reset yourself and to get ready for another long hard period of work.

You need to get that time off to be able to perform at your maximum.

This post is short, but that is because it’s my down period, but I don’t wan’t to break any streaks here.
  
I like writing a blog post every single week.

So this post is me doing three things: telling you that breaks are important, not ending a current streak, and lastly, still taking my own break.
