Welcome to Picks of the month, where I share a few things I have found useful the last month.

It can be anything from blog posts and software tools to books and techniques.

# #1 Linux

I recently switched both my work and personal computer to Linux (from Windows and Mac respectively).

Using Linux has been a real joy. It breathed some fresh air into my daily routine, and keep doing so by being pure awesome.

&nbsp;

I use Fedora for work, and Ubuntu for my personal development machine. Both are running Gnome 3 as the Desktop Environment.

I still use IntelliJ as my IDE, and it happens to work perfectly on Linux (thanks JetBrains!).

&nbsp;

As a bonus, I learn more about Linux while using it. I feel like it's more worthwhile to be good in Linux than in any other OS. I am also much more comfortable logging into deployed servers to fix stuff now.

# #2 Playstation 4

I had a pretty recent period of feeling extremely overwhelmed.

I still do actually, and I wrote about not feeling like you have the time to do what you want to do.

To combat this feeling, I figured that I needed to actually do something for my own pure enjoyment.

Not feeling like I needed to achieve something big for a few hours. And as such I bought PS4 with a couple of games (Far Cry 4 and Metro Redux - both great games!).

It has been a blessing to be able to take couple of hours now and then to just rewind completely. Not thinking about work, career and all the things I want to be able to do has been just what I needed.
