Welcome to Picks of the month, where I share a few things I have found useful the last month.

It can be anything from blog posts and software tools to books and techniques.

# #1 NDC Oslo 2016

I was recently at a fantastic conference here in Norway: NDC Oslo 2016.

It was a three day event, jam-packed with great talks and amazing people.

After the event I really had a bad case of NDC withdrawal. It was so much fun and I learned a ton!

There was even a shrimp cruise on the beautiful Oslo Fjords after the first day.

Tech conferences are a great way to learn new things and meet new people (or connect with people you already know).

I met several people I had only communicated with on twitter and blogs, plus a bunch of people I didn't know at all.

It was great!

I wanted to share a few specific talks as well, and I want to start with one about how to meet new people at these
kind of events:

# #2 Visual Studio Code

I have seen a lot of people using VS code lately and I wanted to know what all the fuzz was about.

I can see it.

It's a really smooth code editor. I am actually using it to write this very post in Markdown.

I have also used it to hash out all my JavaScript code examples for my recent blog posts.

I could have used IntelliJ IDEA for all of that, but for smaller projects, it seems like a bit of overkill.

If you want a free, fast and smooth code editor, I can really recommend Visual Studio Code.
