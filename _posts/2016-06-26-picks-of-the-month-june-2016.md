Welcome to Picks of the month, where I share a few things I have found useful the last month.

It can be anything from blog posts and software tools to books and techniques.

# #1 NDC Oslo 2016

I was recently at a fantastic conference here in Norway: NDC Oslo 2016.

I had a really great time. I learned a lot of new stuff, and met a lot of new people.

I was planning on writing everything about this years NDC in this post, but it got so big
that I had to put it into it's own post!

Therefore:
 
[NDC Oslo 2016]({{ site.baseurl }}/ndc-oslo-2016/){:target="_blank"}

# #2 Visual Studio Code

I have seen a lot of people using VS code lately and I wanted to know what all the fuzz was about.

I can see it.

It's a really smooth code editor. I am actually using it to write this very post in Markdown.

I have also used it to hash out all my JavaScript code examples for my recent blog posts.

I could have used IntelliJ IDEA for all of that, but for smaller projects, it seems like a bit of overkill.

If you want a free, fast and smooth code editor, I can really recommend Visual Studio Code.

# #3 Uncharted 4: A Thief's End

I've had some stressful couple of weeks at work, and I needed to play a game.
