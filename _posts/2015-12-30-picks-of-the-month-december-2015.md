Welcome to Picks of the month, where I share a few things I have found useful the last month.

It can be anything from blog posts and software tools to books and techniques.

# #1 Vacation

I have picked this one before. But I am currently on Christmas vacation, and it is just so crucial for me.

After quite a few months without much time off, some vacation is extremely important.

I know that I need to charge up my batteries again.

&nbsp;

So, remember to take all the vacation you can, because you won't be very efficient if you run on fumes the next year!

# #2 The new Coldplay album: "A Head Full of Dreams"

I like Coldplay quite a bit. They have many good songs. But their latest album is _really_ working for me!

So many good songs that I just listen to over and over and over and... Yeah.

&nbsp;

If you haven't given it a listen, I would recommend that you do. It's a classic album in my book.

# #3 Angular 2 Beta

Angular 2 is finally out of Alpha! That means that the API's are more stable and as such: the time to play around with it is definitely here!

&nbsp;

I have not played much around with Angular 2 yet, but I have viewed quite a few videos on it, and read some code. It looks like a very good step for Angular. Also, it looks like a lot of fun!

&nbsp;

I will probably start playing with it soon. Also I will move some of my projects over from Angular 1.x, as soon as I feel it is stable enough.
