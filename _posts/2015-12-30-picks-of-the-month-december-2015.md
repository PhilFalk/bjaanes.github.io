Welcome to Picks of the month, where I share a few things I have found useful the last month.

It can be anything from blog posts and software tools to books and techniques.

# #1 Vacation

<a href="http://gjermundbjaanes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Depositphotos_49213857_s-2015.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-512"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-512" src="http://gjermundbjaanes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Depositphotos_49213857_s-2015.jpg" alt="Chill vacation" width="432" height="271" /></a>

I have picked this one before. But I am currently on Christmas vacation, and it is just so crucial for me.

After quite a few months without much time off, some vacation is extremely important.

I know that I need to charge up my batteries again.

&nbsp;

So, remember to take all the vacation you can, because you won&#8217;t be very efficient if you run on fumes the next year!

# #2 The new Coldplay album: &#8220;A Head Full of Dreams&#8221;

<a href="http://gjermundbjaanes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Coldplay_-_A_Head_Full_of_Dreams.png" rel="attachment wp-att-511"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-511" src="http://gjermundbjaanes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Coldplay_-_A_Head_Full_of_Dreams.png" alt="Coldplay A Head Full of Dreams Cover" width="175" height="175" srcset="http://gjermundbjaanes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Coldplay_-_A_Head_Full_of_Dreams.png 300w, http://gjermundbjaanes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Coldplay_-_A_Head_Full_of_Dreams-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 175px) 100vw, 175px" /></a>

I like Coldplay quite a bit. They have many good songs. But their latest album is _really_ working for me!

So many good songs that I just listen to over and over and over and&#8230; Yeah.

&nbsp;

If you haven&#8217;t given it a listen, I would recommend that you do. It&#8217;s a classic album in my book.

# #3 Angular 2 Beta

<a href="http://gjermundbjaanes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/shield-large.png" rel="attachment wp-att-513"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-513" src="http://gjermundbjaanes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/shield-large.png" alt="Angular 2 Shield" width="168" height="183" /></a>

Angular 2 is finally out of Alpha! That means that the API&#8217;s are more stable and as such: the time to play around with it is definitely here!

&nbsp;

I have not played much around with Angular 2 yet, but I have viewed quite a few videos on it, and read some code. It looks like a very good step for Angular. Also, it looks like a lot of fun!

&nbsp;

I will probably start playing with it soon. Also I will move some of my projects over from Angular 1.x, as soon as I feel it is stable enough.
