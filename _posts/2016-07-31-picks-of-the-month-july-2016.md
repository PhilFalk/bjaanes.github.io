Welcome to Picks of the month, where I share a few things I have found useful the last month.

It can be anything from blog posts and software tools to books and techniques.

<!--more-->

Since this month has been all about work, and then later vacation, there are not
that many picks.

# #1 Docker Deep Dive

I have been interested in Docker for a while. The concept of containers have seemed 
very cool, but I haven't really had the time to take the plunge.

Until now.

Docker Deep Dive is a Pluralsight by [Nigel Poulton](https://twitter.com/nigelpoulton){:target="_blank"}. It takes you from zero to "hero".
 
The course is extremely well laid out, and the course author is very pedagogical.
He explains things in a very understandable matter, and repeats them through the course,
without getting boring.

If you want to learn what Docker can do, and how to operate it all, consider this course:

# #2 Tech Videos gone SitCom

This is not a very serious pick, but a very fun one!

During a twitter conversion, we came up with the idea to add sitcom to tech talks,
because the recordings often doesn't pick up on how the audience responds to jokes.

I found the result very funny, but take a look for yourself:
