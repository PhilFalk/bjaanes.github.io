Welcome to Picks of the month, where I share a few things I have found useful the last month.

It can be anything from blog posts and software tools to books and techniques.

# #1 OpenHAB

I have spent some time playing with OpenHab in my Smart Home series, and found it quite powerful. Not **that** easy to use, but very powerful and flexible.

It can do so much.

OpenHAB, in their own words is:
  
"a vendor and technology agnostic open source automation software for your home"

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

It's basically a very powerful home automation hub that works with a bunch of different types of technologies.

It's not the easiest to set up, because you have to fiddle with a bunch of configuration files. But it works, and it can do everything you want a hub like this to do.

I hope the next version of OpenHAB (OpenHAB 2) is a bit simpler to set up, with less configuration files to fiddle around with.

But at least for now, it's the best option I've found.

# #2 Angular 2 Upgrade

For my personal project - and for work too, actually - I have had the pleasure of playing around with Angular 2 upgrade path.

It's an upgrade adapter that allows you to run Angular 1 and Angular 2 side by side. It's very fascinating. And super practical if you don't want to do a &#8216;big bang' upgrade.

It allows you to create component structures like this:

That means that you can mix and match Angular 1 and 2 while upgrading at your own pace.

&nbsp;

And you might not want that, because rewriting your Angular 1 application to Angular 2 is not exactly trivial.

I will be writing more about this in other posts coming soon.

If you want to learn more about the Angular 2 upgrade path, take a look at this document:

# #3 Denon AH-MM400

I recently purchased a new headset, because I was sick of poor sound quality and extreme leakage (people started to complain...).

I listen to music every day at work, at home, and anywhere else it might make sense. I love music. Therefor I felt it might be justified to spend a little extra on a great headset.

&nbsp;

I bought a Denon AH-MM400. It is very easy on the eyes, and luckily also very powerful and great on the ears.

They are also very comfortable, and having them on for many hours isn't a problem.

Like I said, they are not very cheap, going for $399 on Amazon, but they are well worth the money in my opinion.

(I bought mine at a Norwegian store called HiFi-Klubben)

# #4 MobaXterm

I have used Windows for work and home for a few weeks and I felt horrible without a practical way to SSH into my different Linux boxes (the server that runs this blog for instance).

I have found that MobaXterm is the best option for SSH on Windows. At least for now. When BASH On Ubuntu On Windows comes along, I might change my mind!

It allows me to set up sessions and access them easily. I can even save all the computers I access, so that I can easily get back to them later.

If you are using a lot of SSH on windows, you might want to take a look at this fine application.

Take a look, it has a great free version that should work for many people (me included):
