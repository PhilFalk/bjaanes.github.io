As software developers, our job is to sit a lot. 

Well, its actually to develop a lot, but it usually involves a whole lot of sitting. 

<!--more-->

Unless you have a standing desk, you are probably sitting 8 hours a day, and then probably sitting even more when you get home. 

That is no way to live. And even if you don’t sit all day when you get home, it’s still too much sitting still. 

Actually it is killing your body - AND your productivity (short term and long term).

&nbsp;

# Exercise

First things first: start exercising! There is just no good reason not to. You will actually be a LOT more productive if you get your body in a bit better shape. Your head can stay in the game longer and you body wont get in your way. In order to function, we have to take care of all parts of your machinery. The body is a huge part of that. If you do not maintain it, it will fall apart, and you will get nothing done.

# Sitting. Don't.

&nbsp;

Sitting. We are just not made for it. The human body does not work properly when sitting on it's ass all day. And while you might (and really should!) get some exercise every day, you still need to take some breaks from sitting too. The sitting marathons we take part in every day is destroying our bodies. Almost every part of your body suffers from this. Not only that, but your MIND even suffers from it. If you stand up every once in a while and walk around a bit, not only will you feel better, but your mind will refresh and get ready to work again!

&nbsp;

# Why not sit?

Your body hates it. Sitting increases risk for a large number of things, some of which are:
  
Mortality, High cholesterol, Obesity, Back pain, Type 2 diabetes, Slow blood circulation, Colon cancer, Cardiovascular disease, dangerous blood glucose levels.

That sucks.

Also, In term of energy levels, sitting takes a heavy toll on it. Coding with high efficiency is very difficult when your head is not in the game.

&nbsp;

# Why stand up?

You will be at lower risk all the health reasons listed above, but you will also get some other benefits:
  
Getting energized, refreshing your focus, getting more productive, and it can even help with your overall stress levels.

I cannot stress this enough, but if you are in no way convinced that this is a huge deal, I highly recommend you go and read up on the subject. It might be the best thing your ever did.

**Take a stand. Get off your ass. Stand up for yourself.**
