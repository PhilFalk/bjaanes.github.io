Welcome to Picks of the month, where I share a few things I have found useful the last month.

It can be anything from blog posts and software tools to books and techniques.

<!--more-->
This month I have a couple of resources I think you might really benefit from. One is a developer resource that any web developer should be familiar with, the other an aid for your mind.

I hope you enjoy this month's picks!

# #1 MDN - Mozilla Developer Network

MDN is a great site for all things web documentation. MDN is one of the sites that usually comes up when you google for html, css or javascript stuff. They are a much more open and comprehensive resource than their counterpart w3schools.

The provide documentation for Web API’s, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and more. They also have great tutorials for learning these technologies.

# #2 Headspace

I have always like the idea of meditation and mindfulness. It always was on my ‘someday’ list to get started with it in some form.

I was inspired by this talk by Igor Minar (from the Angular Core Team) from ng-conf 2015:

He also made a page for this particular talk that you can check out here:

<a href="http://igorminar.github.io/story-about-superpower-management/" target="_blank">http://igorminar.github.io/story-about-superpower-management/</a>

During the talk, Igor recommends an app called Headspace. Headspace has guided meditations that are really great.

Headspace help you understand the concepts of meditation and mindfullness in a very smooth way. It's mostly practical, but you gain some insight into the general practice as well, which is nice.

They have a huge library of guided (and un-guided) meditations that help you every step of the way. You can get started without knowing anything about the processes.

They also provide a 10-day free trail where you can do a 10-day start course to see if it’s a good fit for you. I highly recommend you try this service if you are at all curious about the benefits this can provide for you.
