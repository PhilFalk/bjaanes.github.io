Welcome to Picks of the month, where I share a few things I have found useful the last month.

It can be anything from blog posts and software tools to books and techniques.

# #1 NDC Oslo 2016

I was recently at a fantastic conference here in Norway: NDC Oslo 2016.

I had a really great time. I learned a lot of new stuff, and met a lot of new people.

I was planning on writing everything about this years NDC in this post, but it got so big
that I had to put it into it's own post!

In that post I talk about the social experience I had there, as well as the great talks this year.
I even give you a few specific talks I feel were very good.

# #2 Visual Studio Code

I have seen a lot of people using Visual Studio Code (or VS Code, as I like to call it) 
lately and I wanted to know what all the fuzz was about.

And you know... I can see it.

It really is a  smooth code editor. I am actually using it to write this very post in Markdown.

I have also used it to hash out all my JavaScript code examples for my recent blog posts.

I could have used IntelliJ IDEA for all of that, but for smaller projects, it seems like a bit of overkill.
And I do like to experience new things. And VS Code is just that. It's a different experience for me. 
And a positive one, I might add.

If you want a free, fast and smooth code editor, I can really recommend Visual Studio Code.

# #3 Uncharted 4: A Thief's End

[![Uncharted 4: A Thief's End]({{ site.baseurl}}/img/posts/uncharted4.jpg)]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/posts/uncharted4.jpg) 

I've had a stressful couple of weeks at work, and I needed blow off some steam. 

I needed to have some fun. I needed a great game to pour myself into. Just forget the world and
experience another exiting world, where there are no deadlines.

I kind of had a feeling that Uncharted 4: A Thief's End was going to be just that.

The previous games were really great, and this one was no exception!

If you like adventure games with great story lines and fantastic graphics, you will probably love Uncharted 4!

Only available for Playstation 4.
