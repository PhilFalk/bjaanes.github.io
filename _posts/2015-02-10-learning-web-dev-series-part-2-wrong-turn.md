I'm not learning what I want to learn

<!--more-->
Like i mentioned <a title="Learning Web Dev Series – Part 1: Starting point" href="http://maximumdeveloper.com/learning-web-dev-series-part-1-starting-point/" target="_blank">last time,</a> I have started doing a course on Udemy.com for creating beautiful websites (in a month) with HTML & CSS.

I am almost finished with the Udemy course.

I have learned a lot of Bootstrap....

No, its really not that bad, but its been a lot of magic through Bootstrap, which I don’t particularly like. It’s not that that I don’t like Bootstrap, because it seems _great_, but I don’t like the magic (shortcut) part. Not when I’m trying to learn the basics of CSS and HTML. However, its great fun to make smooth looking websites within an hour or two.

From my experience, in order to debug and fix weird issues with CSS (and basically anything else), you need to have some understand how things actually work. I feel like a strong foundation is always the right call. It has worked very well for me in the past, and I think it might serve me well this time around as well.

The course also repeats itself a lot, and I don't feel like I'm learning enough of the basic foundation. There is a lot of CSS tweaking, which I guess is relevant, but it's also so boring (and again, repetitive)! I already hate CSS - which is not a good start. I truly want to love CSS instead. And I am hellbent on doing just that.

Therefore I am going to start down another path. I understand that my current path is not going to get me exactly where I want, so I’ll adjust. I will however finish the course, since I’m almost done with it (it’s important to finish what you start).

When I have finished the current course on udemy I will start doing some courses on CodeSchool. They seem to cover fundamentals, plus I have heard a lot of great stuff about them. I'll try that for a while and will come back with more on how this adjustment works for me.

# The Journey - Visualized

I have a visual aid to help show where I am currently at on my journey. 
I have created a “prezi” presentation to visualize my path more clearly.

It will be updated through the course of this series – so it might be longer than the current post you are reading.
