First &#8220;picks of the month&#8221; this year!

This month I have a few new obsessions of mine to share.

&nbsp;

# #1 Raspberry Pi

<a href="http://gjermundbjaanes.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/rpi1bplus-1.png" rel="attachment wp-att-563"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-563" src="http://gjermundbjaanes.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/rpi1bplus-1-449x304.png" alt="Raspberry Pi" width="449" height="304" /></a>

In my Smart Home series, I recently <a href="http://gjermundbjaanes.com/smart-home-series-part-4-out-with-arduino-in-with-raspberry-pi/" target="_blank">threw out Arduino from my project plans</a>, and replaced it with Raspberry Pi as the primary device.

Never been happier about that choice! These cute, affordable machines that can run Linux really rubs me the right way. Linux <3

I look forward to having a bunch of these connected around in my home, being just an SSH connection away.

# #2 Cross-Country Skiing

<a href="http://gjermundbjaanes.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Depositphotos_53642359_s-2015.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-564"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-564" src="http://gjermundbjaanes.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Depositphotos_53642359_s-2015-449x304.jpg" alt="Cross-country skiing stock photo" width="449" height="304" /></a>

We recently had a bunch of snow fall at home, and since running outside in a bunch of snow is completely out of the question for me, I turned to Cross-Country Skiing.

Turns out, it&#8217;s super fun!

I have skied before, but it was almost 10 years ago, and probably not voluntarily.

After a couple of clumsy runs on the local ski track, I can finally get around at a pretty OK pace. It&#8217;s still not Petter Northug or Therese Johaug, but it&#8217;s enough to get me out of breath.

So, if you have snow, and want a fun way to exercise: try Cross-Country Skiing.

# #3 Nexus 5X

<a href="http://gjermundbjaanes.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/nexus5x.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-566"><img class="alignnone wp-image-566 " src="http://gjermundbjaanes.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/nexus5x-e1454164373752.jpg" alt="Nexus 5X" width="318" height="318" /></a>

My iPhone 6 had been acting up for a few months, with poor battery time and some other wierd behivour.

I wanted to try something else again. So I went and bought myself Nexus 5X.

&nbsp;

I have previously been very happy with the Nexus devices, and this time was no different.

I can&#8217;t stand the bloated Samsung and other devices like that &#8211; I want my Android plain and nice, without all the extra &#8220;software&#8221; the other vendors insist on putting on their phones.

What you get with the Nexus devices is simple: Pure Android, they way it was intended by Google.

&nbsp;

The price is very much right for this phone. It costs almost half of the newest iPhone, and it only feels slightly cheaper. It feels just as fast and responsive, and I have yet to miss anything from Apple land. Very much value for you money.

The fingerprint reader is much faster, and more ergonomically placed than on my old iPhone 6. I can actually use it without it being &#8220;in the way&#8221;.

The battery life is not ideal. It certainly lasts the day, but I would be more comfortable if the battery lasted at least two days (which my iPhone 6 never did either).
