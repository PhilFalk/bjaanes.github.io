After more than a year as a great side project, Extreme Results is finally ready for a preview release!

&nbsp;

Extreme Results is a web app for a productivity system called Agile Results.

In short, Agile Results is a goal oriented system focused on results, not tasks.

You can read more about both Agile Results and the web app here:

Extreme Results aims to make Agile Results much simpler to implement. 
You get contextual help, like related outcomes and reflections when creating your daily outcome.

It also gives you one location to implement your Agile Results.

I use the web app every day, and it has been shaped out of a personal need for a 
more complete solution than the market currently offers (hint: it offers nothing today).

__And just to make it clear: I am in no way associated with Agile Results, Getting Results the Agile Way or the
creators of said products.__

# Open Source

As with basically everything I do, Extreme Results is completely Open Source.

The are many reasons for this:

* I *love* Open Source software
* I want anyone to view and learn things from what I've done
* I want anyone to be able to work on this project
* I want anyone to be able to teach __me__ things
 
If you want to get involved, please just let me know.
 
I'll be happy to work with people on this project.

Evey line of code is on Github:

* [XR Server Code](https://github.com/bjaanes/ExtremeResults-Server)
* [XR Web App Code](https://github.com/bjaanes/ExtremeResults-WebApp)
