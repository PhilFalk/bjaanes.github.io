Welcome to Picks of the month, where I share a few things I have found useful the last month.

It can be anything from blog posts and software tools to books and techniques.

# #1 Clean desk

Since I have been playing with hardware a lot during Easter vacation, my desk has been more and more messy.

Cables, Raspberry PI's, phone, tablet, memory cards, etc, etc. Just a bunch of stuff I "need" to have there all the time.

Or not. I found myself less and less inclined to sit down at my messy desk. So I finally cleaned it, and my work actually sped up a lot!

The funny thing is that I KNOW this stuff. Heck, I wrote about it a while ago:


[Keep your life (and code) clutter-free]({{ site.baseurl}}/keep-your-life-and-code-clutter-free/){:target="_blank"}

&nbsp;

Still, I make these mistakes. The important thing is to know when they happen, and correct them:

# #2 Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard and Mouse

I used to get a lot of trouble with my arms and hands after working for longer periods of time.

I felt carpel tunnel syndrome creeping up on me.

Luckily, I found a keyboard and mouse that works wonders for me: Microsoft's Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard and Mouse.

It takes a bit of time to get used to, but it feels very natural to use after a short while. And my arms doesn't hurt anymore!

# #3 .service() versus .factory(), the actual answer

This is an article I found in my twitter feed recently. It is written by Todd Motto, an excellent Angular developer.

It explains _super_ clearly the differences between factory and service in the Angular 1.X API.

After reading this, you should be able to know exactly when (and how) to use each one.
