Welcome to Picks of the month, where I share a few things I have found useful the last month.

It can be anything from blog posts and software tools to books and techniques.

<!--more-->

I am still reading a lot, so this month is also all about books. I'm a really book focused period right now, and I enjoy it immensely. I learn a lot, and it's very relaxing. 

If you want to add me on goodreads, please do:

I read a lot of fiction, non-fiction (science stuff mostly), self-help/productivity, religion and of course technical books.


All links to Amazon and such are **not** anything I make money from or anything. They are just a helpful link.

# #1 The Innovators: How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution

[![The Innovators Cover]({{ site.baseurl}}/img/posts/innovators_cover.jpg)]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/posts/innovators_cover.jpg)

The innovators is a mixed history and biography book. It goes through the history of computers, all the way from Ada Lovelace to Apple and Google.

The book outlines the great innovators that helped bring forth the digital revolution. It also tells the story of how great teams can do a lot more than even great loners. The books was really got me thinking about how innovation comes not only from great minds, but from great teams too (more often than from single minds, I think).
 
If you are at all interested in the men and women behind the digital revolution, and how they made it all happen, this is a book for you!

# #2 Flowers for Algernon

This is an old classic actually, first published in 1959. It's one of the better books I've read recently.

The story is a fantastic mix between interesting and thought provoking plot, development of characters and good writing style. It's an easy read too. 

The book tells the story of Charlie Gordon, a man with an IQ of 68. He gets the opportunity to receive a surgery that is going to make him more intelligent. His journey from mentally challenged to something quite the opposite is worth the read.

# #3 The Fold

[![The Fold Cover]({{ site.baseurl}}/img/posts/the_fold_cover.jpg)]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/posts/the_fold_cover.jpg)

A newer science fiction book about a group of scientist that have created a kind of teleporter device. The science behind the teleporter is a mystery to everyone outside the group of scientist. The teleporter seems to work though. It works every single time, yet something seems very very wrong. 

The plot of this story is full of twists and turns that make for a great read. Very entertaining book. Cool science fiction is always fun!
