**Disclaimer: I am no doctor, so please talk to you physician before going ahead and do anything about your possible problems.**

Really, go ask your doctor for some help. Perhaps he can get you in touch with a specialist that can provide further help.

That said, the following tips are pretty non-controversial, and would probably do little harm.

If you want to learn more about shoulder tendonitis and what causes it, and the names of the muscles that are effected (and such), you need to do that research on your own. This post is all about how to fix it.

&nbsp;

Lately, I have had (past tense, **yay!**) issues with my shoulder.

It was all because i sit in front of the computer, programming all day, every day. So I started developing something besides awesome software; _shoulder tendonitis (SAD FACE)_.

&nbsp;

It's very important to take steps to fix the problem before it becomes a huge issue, where you can't work at all. Nobody wants that.

&nbsp;

# Stop!

First things first, cut down on computer time and other activities that hurt your shoulder. I didn't stop working (it's my job after all), but I had to cut down on my own coding time.

This certainly sucks, but until the problem is solved, you need to chill out for a while. I got better after a few weeks (but still working my day job - and some occasional coding at home).

&nbsp;

# Get moving!

You need to exercise. Cardio that gets your arms moving. Walking, running, ellipse machine, etc. Biking won't help much, because you need blood flowing to those inflamed shoulders.

If you can, try to do some very light strength exercises for your shoulders. Mostly rotator and supraspinatus exercise. For example, take a look here:

The most important thing is that is should NOT hurt. At all! The best thing you can do is get some physiotherapist and get them to show you some exercises (and get even more tips).

&nbsp;

# Take a break!

When you do sit down and work, get up every 30 minutes or so and move around. Roll your shoulders and walk around. Get blood flowing.

It's also very beneficial for health and productivity, so thats good! I actually wrote a little bit about that recently: <a href="http://maximumdeveloper.com/why-its-so-important-to-stand-up/" target="_blank">Why it’s so important to stand up</a>

&nbsp;

# Secret sauce!

I have one last tip that might be slightly controversial, but at least not harmful in any way (that I am aware of at least).

My little secret fixer is heat rub stick. The one i used is called Linnex, but I am sure there are others like it.

You rub the stick on the areas where you have pain. After about 15 minutes it starts to get really hot on the applied area. It even hurts a little sometimes, it’s that hot. Afterwards the shoulders feel much better.

The stick get some serious blood flow through your shoulders and the painful areas. I used this a couple of times every single day, and I believe it really helped my shoulders out.

# Take it seriously!

Please, do not ignore your pain - shoulders or otherwise. Ignoring it will most certainly kick you hard in the teeth pretty soon. And it will _not_ be worth it!

Good luck!
