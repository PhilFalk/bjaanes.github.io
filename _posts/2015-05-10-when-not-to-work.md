You certainly want to work as much as possible, and as effective as possible. After all, you want to be the best you can. You want to write the cleanest, meanest code you possible could.

You want to learn as much as humanly possible. You just want to code, dammit!

And please do. BUT &#8211; sometimes, it’s time to take a break.

Sometimes you just need to stop working and do something else.

If you don’t, it will come back and bite you hard in the ass! If you get burnt out, or injured, it won’t help that you powered through the pain, because you’ll be out of the game for an even longer time. It&#8217;s just not effective use of your time. And nobody wants that.

When the time for that comes, only you can truly know, because it will differ from person to person. There are however a few important things to consider that are pretty universal. It all boils down to listening to your body and your mind. It will tell you.

You will be told with pretty good clues:

# You are hurting physically

Your body is telling you to take a break!

Your arms ache. Your back is killing you. It’s starting to feel like you might be getting carpel tunnel syndrome. Whatever it is, you know what I am talking about. Your body begs you to stop hurting it with repetitive actions.

There are of course things you should do to minimize these things. Exercise. Use ergonomic keyboard and mice. Have a good chair. Sit correctly. Switch positions a lot. Take many breaks. But even if you are doing that, it might be too much for the body. It wasn’t built for sitting in front of the computer, and you just have to acknowledge that.

The main thing is, don’t let it get worse, because it will be hell to get better.¨

&nbsp;

# You are absolutely exhausted mentally

&nbsp;

Your mind is telling you to take a break!

If it feels like your brain is not working properly, it’s because it probably isn’t. So why are you wasting your time working? Recharge, dammit!

If you are not focused on your task, you shouldn’t even do it. Just stop. Take a break until you are fit to focus again.

It’s not much point to grinding your way through coding when you mind isn’t working. You will just need to write that code again later. You will make so many stupid mistakes. It’s like writing code drunk, only it’s not fun.

&nbsp;

# You are sick

Your body is telling you to take a break!

This is almost like the first point. Actually, it’s the exact same. If you are sick, you need to get well. Don’t FORCE yourself to code or whatever. Wait until you really want to again. You can of course work a bit when sick, as long as you are not making things worse.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

In summary, you shouldn’t work when your body or mind is exhausted and tired. It’s natures nice way to tell you to slow down. You don’t want nature to tell you in any other way.
