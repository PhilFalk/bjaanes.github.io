Welcome to Picks of the month, where I share a few things I have found useful the last month.

It can be anything from blog posts and software tools to books and techniques.

# #1 Angular Performance: Tuning the Engine by Todd Motto

I recently attended a neat webinar with Todd Motto about Angular 1.X performance tuning.

I knew a lot of the stuff covered, but I learned a few new things, and got reminded of a few others that I had forgotten about.

Even if you know a lot of Angular performance tricks, there is always more to learn! 
If you develop Angular 1.X applications, I suggest that you take a look at the recording.

# #2 Jekyll

Jekyll is a static website generator. It allows you to create a nice and simple blog with Markdown files and simple configuration.

I recently moved this very blog from Wordpress to Jekyll.

I have worked with it for the last couple of weeks, and it has been a blast. Always fun with new technology of course, 
but I was actually able to primarily focus on my content rather than the platform.

Being able to have a much lighter footprint, and simpler technology stack is very neat, but having all my content on Github, that is just gold!

I mean:

* Everything is source controlled
* I can publish with "git push"
* I can accept pull requests (to fix spelling mistakes for instance, or even new posts if someone wanted to write one)
* Less backup to worry about (I trust Github <3)

I wrote in more detail about the reasons for the switch here:

# #3 Hackathon

This is perhaps a slightly abstract pick, but I recently attended Angular Attack 2016, an online Angular hackathon:
[https://www.angularattack.com/](https://www.angularattack.com/){:target="_blank"}

![Angular Attack Logo]({{ site.baseurl}}/img/posts/angularattack-logo.png) 

It was a bunch of fun and I learned a lot about Angular 2, MQTT and Websockets. All in all it was a fun and educational.

If can attend either a physical or online hackathon that fit you, I really recommend that you do it. 
It allows you to really let yourself loose and just learn something new and cool within a short period of time.

If you want to read some more about what I created, you can read my blogs post about it:
[Angular Attack 2016 Submission]({{ site.baseurl }}/angular-attack-2016-submission/){:target="_blank"} 

The app allows you view MQTT data in real time. I called it the MQTT Dashboard. The technology behind it is described in the blog post linked above.

If you just want to take the app for a spin, you can find it here:
[http://bjaanes.2016.angularattack.io/](http://bjaanes.2016.angularattack.io/){:target="_blank"}
 
The code is as always available on Github:
[https://github.com/rumblex/angularattack2016-bjaanes](https://github.com/rumblex/angularattack2016-bjaanes){:target="_blank"} 

And if you would like to view a quick demo of it, I've got you covered on that as well:
