Welcome to Picks of the month, where I share a few things I have found useful the last month.

It can be anything from blog posts and software tools to books and techniques.

<!--more-->
A little late picks of the month this time. I was in London for a vacation with my family, and <a href="http://gjermundbjaanes.com/i-dont-have-time-for-it-all/" target="_blank">I just didn&#8217;t have the time for everything</a>.

No matter, here is my picks for November 2015!

&nbsp;

# #1 Working out!

I might have picked something like this before, but I don&#8217;t care! I just want to share some of the amazing effects my workout have been giving me.

  * I lost a bunch of weight 
      * I am almost at my ideal weight now, which feels awesome!
  * I have more energy 
      * When doing a few heavy workout a week, I just feel so much more energized during the work day as well. And in the evenings too!
  * I look better 
      * This of course goes along with the weight stuff, but being just a bit more defined is most certainly a confidence booster!
  * I get less sick 
      * Usually, during these freezing times of the year, I get quite a few small colds (nothing big usually, but still runny nose and all that jazz). Now I don&#8217;t! At least not yet (Knock on Wood!).
  * I feel better 
      * This probably is because of all the above points, but I just feel better about myself. Which of course is great!

So my biggest pick for November is working out. Just do it!

# #2 Shopping in London

I went to London with my girl friend and my familiy, and it was great. I went to see a musical (Cats) and saw some of the regular tourist stuff (big ben and such).

But, the biggest thing that amazed me was the sheer amount of fantastic places to shop. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I knew London was great for shopping, but it was just over top for clothes and fashion for men (because that is what I looked for).

I&#8217;ll admit, most of it was a bit on the expensive side, but it was just so cool anyways. I really want to go back with a stuffed wallet and go crazy!

If you are into men&#8217;s fashion, go to London! (seriously, search a little on the web, there are a BUNCH of great stores and boutiques.)

# #3 The Nexus books

I am not quite done with all three books yet, but the first two has been a great experience.

The books are about a future where nano-drugs can enhance humans and basically turn their mind into a super computer, linking them together and doing amazing things. The problem is of course that many people are afraid of this, which causes witch hunts against &#8220;non-humans&#8221;/&#8221;post-humans&#8221;.

The author, Ramez Naam, is a computer scientist which knows quite a few things about the stuff he is writing about. It feels like this \*almost\* could be real in the future.

Inspiring books so far. I really recommend at least trying out the first book. Seriously cool stuff, especially for programmers, because there is a lot of programming talk in them.
