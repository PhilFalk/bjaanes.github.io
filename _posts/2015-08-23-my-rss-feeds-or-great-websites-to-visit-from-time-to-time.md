RSS is a fantastic way to keep current with lots of different sources, without the hassle of going through a bunch of sites every day. You make sure you never miss something important. It&#8217;s a huge help for me when trying to stay up to date all the time (especially on web development, which we all know is moving extremely fast).

<!--more-->
I wanted to share the list of all my current RSS feeds I follow. I really want to keep this list up to date, so I will try my very best to keep it current at all times.

The list consists of many different pages covering different topics. The topics can be things like: productivity, angular, web development in general, programming in general, blogs from people like me (which means passionate developer, just in case you wondered!).

I try to keep the list as neat as possible. Feeds that push out a lot of content better be pushing out a lot of good content, or else I will delete it pretty fast.

You can also download an export of my subscriptions from feedbin here:

&nbsp;

Also, if you have any great tips for feeds I should use (and feature here), let me know!

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Feeds

&nbsp;

## Inspirational/Productivity

The blogs and websites here are mainly about productivity and inspiration.

I like to sprinkle in some deep and reflective stuff in my feed list. It gets boring with just heavy technical posts all day.

&nbsp;

### 99U

99U provides short but sweet articles about inspiration and creativity. Doesn&#8217;t take much time to read, but the articles provide great value and are well written.

RSS:Â http://99u.com/feed/

&nbsp;

### Fundamental Programmer

Not to frequent postings, but great posts about becoming a greater programmer. Lots of great productivity tips.

### J.D. Meier&#8217;s Blog

J.D. Meier is the author of the fantastic book &#8216;Getting Results the Agile Way&#8217;. The very same book I am basing one of my new apps on (which I wrote about a little here:Â [Extreme Results](http://gjermundbjaanes.com/learning-web-dev-series-part-5-extreme-results/))

Meier posts inspirational and productivity-centered posts.

Written by John Sonmez who know a thing or two about productivity, inspiration, selling, programming and a quite few other things as well.

## Web Development / Web Design

I am in love with web development (and especially front-end), so most of my feed is concerned with just that. However I would like to level up a bit with my design skills as well, so I follow some site that write about that too.

If you are into Web,Â the feeds here might be of huge help to you!

&nbsp;

### Smashing Magazine

Frequent postingsÂ about everything related to web development and design. Fantastic resource for learning just about everything in the front-end web domain.

They even have books!

## 

## General

Blogs and websites that posts about anything related to development and software engineering. Many of the greatest posts comes from here. That might be because it contains blogs from people like Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) and Martin Fowler.

I am a Software Engineer, so this stuff reallyÂ works for me.

&nbsp;

### The Clean Code Blog

From my favorite person in Software Development, Robert C. Martin (also known as Uncle Bob).

I incidentally wrote a bit about just that a while ago: <a href="http://gjermundbjaanes.com/how-i-got-started-with-clean-code/" target="_blank">How I got started with Clean Code</a>.

I might be a bit of a fanboy, but this guy is just funny and seriously smart. Follow this blog.

I don&#8217;t keep many feeds that are unrelated to development or productivity in some way, but there are a few. Under each one I&#8217;ll explain.

### 

### OMG! Ubuntu!

I love Ubuntu and Linux (even though I am using almost exclusively Apple products right now). I like to keep current with what is happening in the Ubuntu Scene, so I like to get a couple of posts in my feed from OMG! Ubuntu! every once in a while.

This is the only tech news site I keep here, because it&#8217;s the only one I don&#8217;t have bookmarked and visit often.

# RSS Reader

I currently use Feedbin to store all my feeds. I use the feedbin.com reader to read my feeds on a desktop, and I use Reeder on iPhone and iPad (which syncs smoothly with feedbin).
