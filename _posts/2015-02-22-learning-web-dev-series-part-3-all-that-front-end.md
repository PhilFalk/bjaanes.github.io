This will be a short update about my progress on learning web development.

<!--more-->
[Last time](http://maximumdeveloper.com/learning-web-dev-series-part-2-wrong-turn/ "Learning Web Dev Series – Part 2: Wrong turn") I mentioned I wanted to get more fundamentals in place before starting to use things like Bootstrap and other utilities that lets you skip a lot of details. I also said that I would do some courses on CodeSchool (and I have). I even got some tips for great learning resources on the web.

# CodeSchool

CodeSchool have their courses lined up into what they call Paths. They are basically courses lined up in some useful order.

I have done quite a few courses on CodeSchool, and they are really great!
  
I started out on the HTML/CSS path where i finished the following courses:

  * Front-end Foundations
  * Front-end Formations
  * CSS Cross-Country
  * Journey Into Mobile

&nbsp;

I also wanted to do something else than just HTML & CSS, so I started down the JavaScript path as well. There i have finished:

  * JavaScript Road Trip Part 1
  * JavaScript Road Trip Part 2
  * JavaScript Road Trip Part 3
  * Shaping up with Angular.JS (I was just really curious)

# Next up

I feel like I get very much back from doing these courses, and I will continue doing them. There are a few more HTML/CSS courses I want to do, and there is at least 5 courses left on the JavaScript path i want to finish.

BUT, that is not all I am going to do from now on. I will start coding on more small projects to really make all this learning stick. I have done that throughout this journey, but I want to spend even more time doing “real” coding.

As an example of what I have started doing:
  
[http://bjaanes.github.io/](http://bjaanes.github.io/ "http://bjaanes.github.io/")

I want to create a personal page that is just about me, and I want to create it from the bottom up myself. I have started doing the design (lending/stealing bits and peaces from around the web) on my own, but I feel really inadequate when it comes to design, so that is something I might consider learning more about as time goes on. For now though, I will focus on the coding.

All in all, I am very happy that I realized that my previous path was a wrong one. Learning more fundamentals from people who know what they are talking about (hopefully!) seems like a much better path than just learning to create website really fast. I need to have a strong fundament before doing too much

# The Journey – Visualized

I have a visual aid to help show where I am currently at in my journey. I have created a “prezi” presentation to visualize my path more clearly. It will be updated through the course of this series – so it might be longer than the current post you are reading.
