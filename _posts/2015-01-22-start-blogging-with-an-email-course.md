I was originally inspired a lot by John Sonmez to start blogging. I have always wanted to have a blog, but I just never got around to it before.

After reading a lot of John&#8217;s post on his blog (<a href="http://simpleprogrammer.com" target="_blank">http://simpleprogrammer.com</a>) and in his book (Soft Skills) about the benefits, I finally decided that I had to just f\***ing do it. Blogging is fun, it might benefit my career and it might just benefit someone else too (by passing wisdom or whatever).

If you have felt that you wanted to start out blogging, look no further, because John has a 3 week email course that gets you started the right way. He shares lots of insights, tips and tricks that will help you get the most out of your efforts.

Take a look: <a href="http://devcareerboost.com/blog-course/" target="_blank">http://devcareerboost.com/blog-course/</a>
  
 **For the record:**
  
If you take the course, you soon will realize that this particular post is a part of the course, but I would never post links to something I don&#8217;t believe in. I think John Sonmez is a stand-up guy and that he has a lot of knowledge to share. He sells things too, but I think he should be allowed to sell a bit, when he gives away most of his time anyway. The course is full of great tips and you don&#8217;t have to do anything other than get the emails, learn and move on.
