*Note: The name of the blog has been changed since this was written. The blog is now named after myself: Gjermund Bjaanes.*

Still, the content of the blog is mostly the same as mentioned in this post.

Welcome to Maximum Developer.

This is a new blog for the developer who wants to maximise their potential. 

I will share my tips and tricks for programming and life in general, and share my learning experience as I go. I want to point out that I am not claiming to be perfect, or even anywhere close (I am not, just ask my girlfriend), but I am hoping that I can provide some value for someone anyway.

_I just want to share what I'm learning, as I'm learning it._

I believe that a developers potential can only be maximised through a combination of key skills. I have found the most important ones being programming (obviously), productivity and lifestyle. If you are lacking in one of these areas, they can very soon become a real bottleneck for you (even if you are not aware of it right now).

# Who am I?

My name is Gjermund Bjaanes. I am 25 years old, born and raised in Norway. I have recently finished my Bachelor in Computer Engineering (like a computer science degree), and have worked for 6 months as a software engineer in Flatirons Solutions (their Norwegian office). My work has been mostly with Java and web technologies. So I am in no way a seasoned expert in everything (or anything I suppose), but I am really focused on learning as much as possible.

I am a perfectionist, an enthusiast (in every thing that I do), a geek (and a proud one at that) and a self-proclaimed life time learner. I care deeply about software development, and strive to be the very best I can be (and hope I never get to reach that point).

# What this blog is about

I want to write about three big areas of the software developers life that I truly care about myself:

## Programming

Programming is probably the most “straightforward" topic. I will talk about various programming topics that I care about. The topics will of course change over time, dependent on what I am focusing on. There will be technology-dependent topics (eg. some Javascript framework or whatever) and there will be “timeless” best practices (like Clean Code, which lie very close to my heart).

## Productivity

I love productivity! I am not always the most productive person, but I certainly strive to be. I will talk about productivity systems like GTD and Getting Results the Agile Way, but also small productivity methods that can improve the amount of work you get done in a day. Most people can benefit from getting a bit more organised, and that is what productivity systems is mostly about.

## Lifestyle

Your productivity, happiness and successfulness (in anything) is extremely dependent on your lifestyle. Some people seem to just ignore this big aspect in their life, and they suffer from it long-term. If you have a crappy lifestyle, you will be really weighed down (no pun intended) by lack of energy, bad moods, and weak capacity of mind.

There is more to a good lifestyle than just food and exercise. Therefore I will not only talk about that, but also exercises, tips and other topics related to the mind and how to take control of your own life.
