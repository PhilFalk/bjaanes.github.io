I was recently at a fantastic conference here in Norway: NDC Oslo 2016.

It was a three day event, jam-packed with great talks and amazing people.

I had a great time during NDC. I have been to a couple of conferences before, but this was my first NDC.

It was also the best conference I have been to so far. The quality of the entire event was top notch.
Everything from the speakers and the venue, to the food and the people there, was impeccable.

The event site can be found here: [http://ndcoslo.com/](http://ndcoslo.com/){:target="_blank"}

After the event I really had a bad case of NDC withdrawal. I never wanted to leave (even though I _was_ pretty tired).

# Social

The social part of this event was great for me. I had decided to get out of my "shell" a bit, and meet some new people.

And I did! I met people I had talked to on twitter, and I met a lot of people I have never communicated with before.

There was even a shrimp cruise on the beautiful Oslo Fjords after the first day. 
There was shrimp (duh), beer, sunset and lots of great people.

Tech conferences are a great way to learn new things and meet new people (or re-connect with people you already know).

# All The Rage

There were a few themes, hot topics or buzz words that I felt were a big part of the conference.

Probably the most dominant one were **Functional Programming**. Everyone seemed to talk about that.

A list of things I felt like were all the rage this year:

* Functional Programming
* HoloLens
* Modern Web Development
  * Offline
  * Performance
  * New CSS layout
  * Caching
* Modern engineering culture
  * Fail Fast
  * Remote work
  * Happy people make good stuff
* .NET Core 
  * I'm not that into .NET right now, but I couldn't miss .NET Core this year!

# Talks

Like I mentioned, the talks were very good. A lot of really good speakers with many interesting topics.

All 161 talks are available in video format: [https://vimeo.com/channels/ndcoslo2016](https://vimeo.com/channels/ndcoslo2016){:target="_blank"} 

I also wanted to share a few specific talks as well, and I want to start 
with the one about how to meet new people at these kinds of events:

## Becoming a social developer

<p>Make the most of your time here: talk to other developers. This is easy -- and incredibly terrifying. Building your developer network will boost your knowledge, your skills, and your career. See how an introvert can become a social developer while still being true to oneself.</p>

## Performance is not an Option - Building services with GRPC and Cassandra

<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/171704575">Performance is not an Option- Building services with GRPC and Cassandra -  Dave Bechberger</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/ndcconferences">NDC Conferences</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p>In today&#039;s development ecosystem building a service oriented architecture based on a micro services is common practice. With the rise of Big Data and Internet of Things applications making these services highly performant services is no longer an option. In order to accomplish the scalability and performance requirements that customers expect we are required to start thinking differently about how we architect and build these applications in order to meet those demands.<br />
This session will demonstrate a method for creating a highly performant service based application using Google&rsquo;s GRPC and Apache Cassandra in .NET. We will show how you can combine gRPC to minimize communication overhead while leveraging Cassandra to optimize storage of time series data. We will explore these concepts by creating an Internet of Things (IoT) application to demonstrate how you can effectively meet the performance and scalability challenges posed by these new breeds of applications.</p>

## Avoiding the big ball of mud

<p>Over the years I&rsquo;ve seen many implementations of an n-tiered application with an anaemic domain model. You know the kind, presentation, service, data access layer. This architecture whilst quick to start building has its problems. Over time, as the application becomes more complex the codebase will become more and more difficult to maintain, often resulting in a &rdquo;Big Ball of Mud&rdquo;.<br />
In this talk I will present some ideas that address these maintainability problems using a solution with a domain model and command patterns to give you a clean extensible architecture. Further to this we will explore event sourcing and cqrs and the benefits they can bring.<br />
<br />
At the end the you will have seen an alternative way of building business applications, especially those with complex business logic.</p>

<p>How we&#039;re scaling the architecture, ecommerce platform and our business in one of Europe&rsquo;s largest e-commerce providers &amp; changing with the business as we go.<br />
Growth problems are good, it means your business is doing well. How can we build an organisation and architecture that gives us room to grow and change, while still keeping our customers happy? At Komplett Group we are going through growth as an organisation in size and scope.<br />
<br />
In this talk we will dive into how the development team at Komplett are breaking up a 10 year old platform. By making every mistake in the book we&rsquo;re building a platform for our future!<br />
<br />
We&rsquo;d like to share our experiences in scaling the architecture and development team. We are breaking a monolith into micro-services to match change within our organization. At the same time we have scaled our web development team from 5 to 50 , and we&#039;re not stopping here!</p>

<p>Javascript is easy to do very badly, but also fantastic when done well. In this session, Jon will walk through some JavaScript best practices to make you a more productive developer.<br />
From linting your code, to adhering to common patterns, Jon will give you practical tips to help prevent some common JavaScript troubles.</p>

# Will I go again?

Yes. Very much so.

I am going to [JavaZone 2016](https://2016.javazone.no/){:target="_blank"} this fall and I can only hope
it will be close to this one.

Next year, I hope to get time to go back to NDC Oslo.

If you are keen on NDC, they are hosted in Sydney (in August!) and London too:
