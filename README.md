# Gjermund Bjaanes' blog

This is my personal blog. 

It's all about programming, productivity and lifestyle. 

It runs on Jekyll and is completely open source. Because I love open source.

I really enjoy contribution. Open Source is awesome for everything!

# Development

To run the blog, you need to install Ruby (so you can run gem commands).

After Ruby is installed, you need to run the following commands:

```bash
gem install jekyll
```

```bash
gem install bundle
```

```bash
bundle install
```

After everything is installed, you can run jekyll commands to serve the blog locally:

```bash
jekyll serve
```
